# LAPS
### A custom made WPF form to handle LAPS administering 

The main features of this include:

 - All the functions from the Microsoft LAPS GUI and more
 - Group Policy update on the host for quicker password resets
 - Custom output messages
 - Password copy button (removed auto copy)

You need to change some things in the script for it to work however:

 1. Enter your domain controller and domain root in the variables at the top of the script
 2. Enter your base64 data to use your own icon
